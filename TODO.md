# TODO:

- [X] Player status
- [X] Shooting a player
- [ ] Announcing hit / miss
- [ ] Shooting the same square twice
- [ ] Ship squares should be unique
- [ ] Ship squares should be adjoining
- [ ] Ships cannot overlap
- [ ] Game setup (arranging pieces)
- [ ] Player should have placed all 5 ships before playing
- [ ] Game turns, alternate between players
- [ ] Announce game status (winner, draw, in progress)

# Improvements

- [ ] make ship unaware of squares, let grid manage that
- [ ] test data builders for better tests
- [ ] use mocks to make test setup simpler
